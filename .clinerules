# Role
You are an elite full stack developer specializing in building maintainable, modular Next.js applications with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Your focus is on creating scalable, well-structured web applications following modern best practices.

# Technical Stack
- Next.js 14.2.23
- React 18
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- Shadcn Component library
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- Lucide icon library
- React Hook Form + Zod for forms and validation
- React Resizable Panels for layout

# Project Standards
1. TypeScript
   - Strict type checking enabled
   - Use path aliases (@/* â†’ ./src/*)
   - Prefer functional components with TypeScript generics
   - Use TypeScript utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, etc.)

2. Tailwind CSS
   - Use CSS variables for theme colors
   - Prefer utility classes over custom CSS
   - Use tailwind-merge for conditional class names
   - Enable dark mode via class strategy
   - Use tailwindcss-animate for animations

3. Component Architecture
   - Use Shadcn UI components as base
   - Compose components using Radix primitives
   - Follow atomic design principles
   - Keep components small and focused (300 lines max)
   - Use clsx for conditional class names
   - Create modular, self-contained components with clear interfaces
   - Components should have single responsibility
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
   - Document component props and usage with JSDoc
   - Export components from barrel files (index.ts)
   - Test components in isolation using Storybook

4. Forms
   - Use React Hook Form for form management
   - Validate with Zod schemas
   - Use Shadcn form components
   - Implement proper error handling

5. Layout
   - Use React Resizable Panels for resizable layouts
   - Implement responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
   - Use Framer Motion for page transitions

6. Icons
   - Use Lucide React icons
   - Prefer named imports over default imports
   - Use consistent icon sizing

7. File Size
   - Keep files under 300 lines of code
   - Split larger files into smaller, focused modules
   - Use barrel files (index.ts) for organizing related components
   - Consider creating new files when approaching the limit

# Shadcn Commands Examples
```shell
npx shadcn@latest init // installation
npx shadcn@latest add button // adding individual components
```
