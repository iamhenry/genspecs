# BDD Test Scenarios for Automated Document Generation Workflow

## Roadmap Generation

Scenario 1: Automatic roadmap triggering
Given: BOM document reaches "accepted" state
When: System validates dependencies
Then: Roadmap generation starts automatically using:
  - README project scope from context
  - BOM technical components from context

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] No user interaction required
- [ ] Stepper shows Roadmap step as "generating"
- [ ] Implementation Plan step remains locked

Scenario 2: Generation dependency validation
Given: BOM document is in "generating" state
When: System processes workflow progression
Then:
  - Stepper shows "in-progress" StepIcon on BOM step
  - System logs "Dependency generation in progress" 
  - Subsequent steps remain locked

## Implementation Plan Generation

Scenario 3: Auto-generated implementation plan
Given: Roadmap document reaches "accepted" state
When: System verifies document states
Then: Implementation Plan generation starts using:
  - Roadmap from context

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Fully automated progression between steps
- [ ] Stepper shows Implementation Plan as "generating"

Scenario 4: Final package preparation
Given: All documents in "accepted" state
When: System completes final validation
Then: ZIP package is created

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Single download available only when complete
- [ ] No partial downloads permitted
